# 📊 Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **Customer Segmentation** using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model to analyze purchasing behavior and identify actionable marketing opportunities.  
It was implemented using **Python**, with visualizations created in **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**, and final results prepared for **Power BI dashboards**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Understand customer purchasing patterns  
- Segment customers into meaningful groups like:
  - **Champions**
  - **Loyal Customers**
  - **At Risk**
  - **Needs Attention**
- Generate actionable marketing recommendations  
- Prepare clean data for visualization in Power BI

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Code & analysis  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source:** [Online Retail Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail)  
- **Format:** `.xlsx` file containing transactional data from an online retail store  

---

## 📌 Steps in the Project  
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed null values
   - Filtered only completed transactions  
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Added `TotalPrice` column  
3. **RFM Calculation**
   - **Recency**: Days since last purchase  
   - **Frequency**: Number of purchases  
   - **Monetary**: Total amount spent  
4. **Scoring & Segmentation**
   - Assigned scores for each RFM metric  
   - Created customer segments using predefined logic  
5. **Visualization**
   - Heatmaps and bar charts for insights  
6. **Export Results**
   - Saved final RFM table as `.csv` for Power BI  

---

## 📈 Insights from Analysis  
- **Champions** generate the most revenue and buy frequently.  
- **At Risk** customers show declining purchases and need re-engagement campaigns.  
- **Loyal Customers** may respond well to loyalty programs or exclusive offers.
